## 1) What it is (today) — automated best-guess

React web app (prototype vs production depends on real data/auth wiring).

## 2) What’s real vs mocked (signals)

- Mock/simulated signals: **2** matches across 1 files
- TODO/FIXME signals: **0** matches across 0 files
- Hardcoded/sample-data signals: **0** matches across 0 files

Top mock/simulated files:
- `index.tsx` (2)

## 3) Core workflow (from docs + entrypoints)

Entry points: `index.tsx`

Docs found:
- `README.md`

## 4) Architecture snapshot

- Detected: UI: react · Framework: vite
- Scripts: `build`, `dev`, `preview`

## 5) Integrations & keywords (what the code talks about)

- offline: 3

## 6) Risks (heuristic flags)

- Potential secret-like strings detected in scanned files (review): `README.md`, `index.tsx`, `vite.config.ts`

## 7) “Should be” (fill this in after review)

Write a single sentence: “This should be …” and list the next 3 steps.

## Appendix A — file type distribution (scanned set)

- .json: 5
- .md: 2
- .css: 1
- .html: 1
- .tsx: 1
- .ts: 1

## Appendix B — deltas vs last run

- Files scanned: +3
- Mock matches: +2
- TODO matches: 0
- Sample-data matches: 0

## Appendix C — prompts (for AI / human review)

- List the 3 most important user roles and the single primary workflow for each.
- Which screens are demo-only (mock data) vs sourced from a database/API?
- Where do secrets live, and what must move server-side to be production-safe?
- What is the smallest MVP slice that delivers measurable value in 2 weeks?
- What should be deleted or deferred to reduce scope without reducing value?
